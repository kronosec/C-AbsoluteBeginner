//Here's some better code. Word to your mother.

int main(void)

/* Why is that code so much better? For one, it sounds like the int main(voids) have the main(s) beat. 
I think in principle you can use main() as a signature or function or something, but it doesn't work in the CS50 sandbox. 
I downloaded Xcode but I have no clue what's going on there. It didn't like include or stdio.h or me personally.

//My computer won't stop laughing at me
//LOL, it says. And I mean it. It thinks the literal LOL is how to laugh. AI is so fake.
